# Smart Dustbin

Smart Dustbin is a project aimed at creating an intelligent waste management system using Arduino, a servo motor, and an ultrasonic sensor. This system automatically opens its lid when someone approaches it with garbage and closes it after the garbage is disposed of, thus promoting hands-free waste disposal and ensuring hygiene.

## Introduction

Smart Dustbin automates the opening and closing of a dustbin's lid using an Arduino microcontroller, a servo motor, and an ultrasonic sensor. When an individual approaches the dustbin with garbage, the ultrasonic sensor detects their presence and triggers the servo motor to open the lid. After the garbage is disposed of, the lid automatically closes, promoting cleanliness and hygiene.

## Setup

To set up the Smart Dustbin project, follow these steps:

1. Connect the servo motor and ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino board using jumper wires.

2. Mount the ultrasonic sensor and servo motor securely onto the dustbin. Ensure that the servo motor is attached to the lid in a way that allows it to open and close the lid smoothly.

3. Upload the Arduino sketch (`SmartDustbin.ino`) to your Arduino board.


## Usage

Once the Smart Dustbin project is set up, you can start using it by following these steps:

1. Power on the Arduino board.

2. Approach the dustbin with garbage in hand.

3. The ultrasonic sensor detects your presence and triggers the servo motor to open the lid automatically.

4. Dispose of the garbage into the dustbin.

5. After a few seconds of inactivity, the lid closes automatically.
