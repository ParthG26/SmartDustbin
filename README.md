# SmartDustbin

Welcome to the SmartDustbin GitHub repository! This project represents a significant leap forward in waste management technology, utilizing modern IoT solutions to enhance efficiency and convenience in handling trash.

## Project Overview

The SmartDustbin is an innovative project that aims to revolutionize the way we manage waste. By integrating technology with a common household item, we've developed a smart dustbin system that not only simplifies waste management but also promotes environmental responsibility.

## Key Features

- **IoT-Enabled Monitoring**: Through the Blynk IoT app, users can effortlessly monitor the fill status of their dustbins in real-time, directly from their smartphones.
- **Automatic Lid Operation**: Utilizing ultrasonic sensors and a servo motor, the dustbin's lid automatically opens and closes based on proximity and fill level, minimizing direct contact and promoting hygiene.
- **Fill Level Detection**: The smart dustbin uses sensors to detect its fill level, informing users when it's time to empty the bin, thereby preventing overflow and promoting cleanliness.

## Components Used

- Cardboard (for the dustbin structure)
- Arduino Uno (as the microcontroller)
- Jumper Wires (for connections)
- Ultrasonic Sensors (for lid operation and fill level detection)
- Servo Motor (for opening and closing the lid)

## How It Works

The SmartDustbin leverages ultrasonic sensors to detect both the approach of a user and the current fill level of the bin. The servo motor is then activated to open the lid automatically when a user is detected nearby, and closes it after the trash is deposited. This automation minimizes the need for physical contact, enhancing hygiene and convenience.

The fill level data collected by the sensors is processed by the Arduino Uno, which communicates this information to the Blynk app through IoT technology. Users can access real-time data on their smartphone via the Blynk app, allowing them to know precisely when the bin needs to be emptied.

## Getting Started

To get started with the SmartDustbin project, follow these steps:

1. **Assemble the Hardware**: Follow the provided schematics to assemble your smart dustbin using cardboard, Arduino Uno, jumper wires, ultrasonic sensors, and a servo motor.
2. **Set Up the Blynk App**: Download the Blynk app on your smartphone and configure it to connect with your Arduino Uno.
3. **Upload the Code**: Program your Arduino Uno with the provided code to enable communication with the Blynk app and the operations of sensors and the servo motor.
4. **Monitor Your Dustbin**: With the setup complete, you can now monitor the fill level of your dustbin through the Blynk app and enjoy the convenience of a smart waste management system.
