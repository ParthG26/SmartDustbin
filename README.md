## 🌟 Introduction
Our Smart Dustbin is engineered to provide a hands-free waste disposal process. It's ideal for high-traffic public areas, minimizing direct contact with waste bins and encouraging effective waste segregation and recycling.

## ✨ Features
- **Automatic Lid Opening** 🚪: A sensor-triggered lid that opens as someone approaches the bin.
- **Fill Level Monitoring** 📏: Sensors to detect how full the bin is, with alerts when it's time to empty it.
- **Voice Command Recognition** 🎤: Hands-free operation with voice commands.
- **Solar-Powered** ☀️: Eco-friendly power from solar panels.
- **IoT Connectivity** 🌐: Blynk integration for remote data access and user notifications.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The Smart Dustbin leverages a primary ultrasonic sensor for motion detection to control the lid via a servo motor. A secondary sensor monitors the fill level, and a solar panel setup powers the unit, all integrated through an Arduino board.

## 🔩 Hardware Components
- Arduino Microcontroller
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- Servo Motor
- Solar Panel
- Rechargeable Battery
- LED Indicator/Buzzer
- Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Module
- Voice Recognition Module

## 💻 Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- Blynk Library
- Voice Recognition Library

## 🔧 Installation
Step-by-step instructions to set up your Smart Dustbin:

1. Assemble the hardware components following the system architecture diagram.
2. Install the Arduino IDE and import the necessary libraries.
3. Flash the provided code to the Arduino.
4. Set up the Blynk project and connect the dustbin to the Blynk app.
5. Install the dustbin in the desired location and ensure the solar panels are properly exposed to sunlight.

## 📊 Usage
Simply approach the dustbin, and the lid will open for you. Say a command, and the bin will respond. Check the Blynk app for fill levels and other notifications.
